        <td>Appearance</td>
        <td>Benimaru is a young man of average height with neck-long, wavy, black hair[4] that partially covers the front of his face. His right pupil is a red circle with a black dot in the middle, and his iris is also black; while his left eye has
          a
          red iris and a white cross-shaped pupil,[4] reminiscent of the tic-tac-toe game. He normally carries a gloomy facial expression. Benimaru's outfit consists of a white t-shirt with a black vest over it, a grey (dark-blue in the anime) kimono
          upper-garment that he only wears on his left arm, and the Special Fire Force uniform trousers that he tucks into his black boots. Previously, he wore black, fingerless gloves and a black jumper, which is wrapped around his waist.
          When not attending a mission, Benimaru is seen wearing a black t-shirt underneath a black samurai-styled hakama, with a white strap around the waist acting as a belt and black boots. Benimaru is later seen wearing a black shirt underneath a
          grey (dark-blue in the anime) kimono upper-garment with the Special Fire Brigade uniform trousers and black boots.</td>

      <tr>

        <td>Personality</td>
        <td>Benimaru is short-tempered, would rather work alone or solely with his brigade, and can be somewhat disrespectful to many of his seniors. Despite this, he has a lot of faith in himself and in his brigade. He doesn't concern himself with
          any
          part of Tokyo other than Asakusa, not caring about the rules that the emperor has created, and proudly acts on his own agenda along with his brigade. He is an honest man, though sometimes honest to the point where he is rude to others.
          Although Benimaru destroys buildings and houses in Asakusa when facing an Infernal, he is seen as a hero and benevolent by the citizens. He seems to care about Asakusa and the people who reside in it, and is upset by having to put an end to
          the life of someone he once knew and becoming extremely angered when misinformed at the cause of death of Kantarō to the point of fighting the entire 8th Brigade. Generally, he is very calm and nonchalant, even while purifying Infernals,
          but
          when angered, fights recklessly. Benimaru is an original country idealist who prefers to be called Shinmon Benimaru, and calling others by their family names before their given names.[5] At the beginning of the attack on Asakusa, Benimaru
          was
          hesitant and not confident about acting as the leader and taking control of the citizens, and would rather let Konro do the job, but after encouragement from his brigade, he finally stepped up to the matter.</td>
